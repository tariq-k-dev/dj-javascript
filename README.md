Use JavaScript event listeners to change the color of a square.  Each event listener has a color associated with it.  All the event listeners are triggered by having the mouse pointer in the square, except for `scroll` event, which is triggered by scrolling outside of the square setting the square color to orange

- `mouseover` gives the square a background color of blue
- `mouseout` will remove all background colors from the square
- `mousedown` changes the square color to red
- `mouseup` changes the square color to yellow
- `dblclick` changes the square color to green

Additionally, by pressing the following keys will set the color of the square:

- `b` - blue
- `g` - green
- `o` - orange

- `r` - red
- `y` - yellow
